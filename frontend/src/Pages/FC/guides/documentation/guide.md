## Inviting

Pilots with T & A badges are entitled to two payouts wherever possible. If a pilot without the A badge has a 2nd paid character in fleet, they must drop it in favor of a pilot with an A badge. Pilots without any badges can be dropped in favor of badged pilots only if they are outside of their required upgrade time (2 weeks from first joining TLA).

FC has the final say on what is allowed into the fleet, however the FC should try to prioritize Marauders over any other DPS ships. The standard fleet comp is as follows:

4 Logi: 2 Nestor - 2 Loki
1 DDD: Vindi
35 DPS: Marauders

*Fleets can be run with 2 Nestor - 1 Loki provided sufficient precautions are taken (e.g., killing yulais in TCRC, having a shield booster on grid, etc.). The FC is responsible for any losses running the lower logi comp.
