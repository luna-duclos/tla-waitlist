# How to not get screamed at as DDD

---

This Guide will have a series of general tips on how to effectively apply your DPS to frigates, along with a detailed breakdown of each site.

## General Tips:

- DDD’ing is best done with a 3 or 4 web Vindicator
- You should have 4 damage mods and Tracking Enhancers/Computers fit
- Splitting guns 4-4 is best.
- Your effective range is roughly between 6km and your heated web range.
- Make sure your speed is as close to 0m/s as possible to maximise tracking when shooting.
- If you are burning or if the frigates aren’t webbed, it is still worthwhile to shoot and hope for a lucky shot.
- Use Faction Antimatter if targets are close, use Null if targets are further away.
- Heating webs is incredibly effective as it gives them an extra few kilometers of range.
- Train up Minmatar and Gallente Battleship skills. Aim for Minmatar Battleship 4 at a minimum.
- Abyssal webs are strongly recommended. Try to aim for 15km range at 60% strength.
- I would recommend learning the anchor spots yourself - try not to rely on someone else.
- Drop booster gives you a tracking bonus - use synth if you don’t want side effects.
- We recommend NOT having an MJD unless it’s a TCRC, in which case you should be able to refit on the in-gate.
- More about MJDs in the TCRC section.

## Applying your DPS to frigates in the initial spawn:

This applies to the TPPH 1st and 2nd rooms, 3rd room 1st wave, NRF 1st wave.

Have faction antimatter loaded.

Burn one or two cycles of prop mod towards the sansha blob (one or two depends on how far the sansha are).

You should ctrl+space (or q-click approach behind you) to slow yourself down when you are around 25-30km away from the frigates.

As you slow down, apply your 3 webs to the 3 closest frigates. I prefer to go for a single target with all my guns.

Once your speed drops below 130m/s, ctrl+space and start shooting.

Once the first frigate dies, move your guns onto another frigate you have webbed, and move your web to another frigate in range.

Repeat that last step until the frigates are all dead or out of your (heated) web range.

Use your own judgement on when to start burning towards your anchor. Keep in mind you can slowboat and still track with your guns.

## Applying your DPS once you are anchored:

(NRF 2nd, 3rd, 4th waves, TPPH 3rd room 2nd, 3rd waves)

You SHOULD have resebos. If not, ask in fleet chat or on comms.

Have faction antimatter loaded (or void if you’re confident in yourself and/or have 25 tracking with void).

Lock up all frigates, and apply your 3 webs to three different frigates.

Once they slow down to roughly 100m/s or less, start firing. Personally, I kill one frigate at a time with all 8 guns.

Once that frigate is dead, move your web to an unwebbed frigate, and your guns to another frigate you have webbed.

Repeat this process until the frigates are dead. Again, use your judgement and listen to FC when you’re anchoring.

## Contests:

You are just a normal vindicator in contests, apart from in the TCRC

Always listen to your FC

TCRC:
If we are the first fleet on grid, kill the first two Niarja. If not, let it live.

If we get the aggro swap, kill the respawning Niarja, otherwise let it live.

## Site Breakdowns:

### TPPH:

Video: https://youtu.be/BpQfs9uv0ts

**First room:**
Enter the room with faction antimatter loaded

Burn one or two cycles of prop mod towards the sansha blob (one or two depends on how far the sansha are).

Ctrl+space (or q-click approach behind you) to slow yourself down when you are around 25-30km away from the frigates.

As you slow down, apply your 3 webs to the 3 closest frigates, usually Schmaeels.

Once your speed drops below 130m/s, ctrl+space and start shooting.

Once the first frigate dies, move your guns onto another frigate you have webbed, and move your web to another frigate in range.

If you are at 0 m/s while repeating the previous step for as long as you can.

If a frigate gets out of range, you can load null and keep shooting, or start burning and have the rest of the fleet clean up the remaining frigates.

**Second room:**
Enter the room with faction antimatter loaded

Much of the same principles as the first room, except there are only 4 frigates. Prioritize killing Schmaeels.

You can start slowboating to the outgate once you kill the first two Schmaeels.

**Third room:**
Enter the room with faction antimatter loaded

The Tamas will get deleted by the vargurs/paladins

Lock the 3 Eysturs and all the Tamas

Burn 1 or 2 cycles towards the sansha blob OR the anchor point, either or.

The principle of killing frigates remains the same. Slow down, web the frigates, shoot them once they are slowed down.

After the first wave, it is a matter of applying your dps once you are anchored. Position yourself between where the wave spawns and the meatshield. Web 3 frigates, shoot one. Once it is dead, move your web to another frigate and shoot a webbed frigate.

Make sure your locks are always full with frigates, especially in the second wave.

Shoot the last tagged osti once the frigates are all dead.

If the frigates run away, load null and shoot the frigates in range.

Third wave only has 3 Schmaeels, so once they are dead you can shoot the Vylade.

### NRF:

Video: https://youtu.be/CDHpySHGf3E (first wave was done contest style)

Enter with faction antimatter loaded

The first wave is done with the same principle as initial spawns in TPPHs

Second wave is much of the same as the TPPH 3rd room 2nd wave. Use your own judgement on when to burn to the next anchor point.

You may be asked to shoot the Mara(s) first. Use your spare webs not on the Mara(s) on the Tamas. If the Tamas run away from you, load null once your webbed targets are dead and start shooting.

Final wave make sure you web and shoot the Eysturs first before they run, then shoot the Romis.

### TCRC:

You only shoot Niarjas and UNTAGGED Schmaeels

**No MJD:**

Video: https://youtu.be/1uNtFzhf834

Enter with NULL loaded

Once you enter, lock up the Niarjas. There will be one around 20-30km away from you.

Shoot it after you have a web on it

Start making your way towards the DDD anchor spot (next to the shield transfer array basically the spheres next to the tower)

Once you are roughly 50km or so away from the second Niarja (the respawner), shoot it. Get a heated web on it if need be

Keep burning towards the anchor spot while shooting untagged Schmaeels.

If the Niarja has respawned, decycle your guns and shoot the Niarja.

Once you are at the spot, keep shooting the untagged Schmaeels. Try to get a web on them if you can. Heat your web if you need to.

Repeat the last two steps until the tower is dead (in which case you align out while killing the rest of the Schmaeels) or you kill the untagged Schmaeels (and then you should shoot the tower).

**With MJD:**

Video: https://youtu.be/oejwt9h1tEA

Enter with faction antimatter loaded

Shoot the Niarja closest to you (should be about 20-30km, burn slightly forwards if you need to).

Shoot untagged Schmaeels in your heated web range - heat your web if you need to.

Once the second Niarja burns into range (about 20-30km from you), get a web on it and kill it.

Once the aggro switches from the meatshield to a ship that jumped to the tower, jump towards the DDD anchor - aim slightly to the left of the tower.

Kill any remaining untagged Schmaeels.

Load void and shoot the tower once they are all dead.
